Description: To cover all the needs for the supply of sensors and associated data acquisition services for the industrialization of DLR (Dynamic Line Rating) solutions, RTE set up a framework market in June 2025. These DLR systems allow, based on one or more parameters measured in the field, to determine a dynamic transit capacity which then replaces the IST/IT values ​​(Temporary Backup Intensity / Overload Intensities) in the management and study tools. This dynamic transit capacity is also referred to by the acronym ampacity (for ampere capacity). The objective is to free up additional margins on the works to remove certain constraints or to manage them differently by optimizing the parades. To do this, the MyDLR solution requires deploying temporary weather stations for a period of two years. This data is then used to train a learning model capable of estimating transit capacities only at from weather forecasts. Once the model is trained, the stations can be removed and reused on other airlines. A descriptive document of the project will be available on the BRAVOSOLUTION platform.

Purchaser Name: SMO PROCESSING HOUSEHOLD WASTE. Summary: Awareness and Engaging Communication Program, Based on a Territorial Diagnosis, Aiming to Improve the Sorting Performance of Individual Housing in the Smitom Nord Territory 77. Description: This public market is a continuation of the 2024 Call for Collection Projects, led by Citeo and Adelphe, for which SMITOM du Nord Seine-et-Marne and its members were the winners. This call for projects aims to optimize the collection selection of household packaging and graphic papers, by improving the quality of the sorting process and reducing the refusal rate at sorting centers. The actions planned in this framework, focusing primarily on dense collective housing sectors, a large part of the SMITOM territory - made up of predominantly individual and low-density residential areas - remains uncovered. The purpose of this contract is to complete the action program initially planned by specifically targeting suburban housing. It aims to set up a diagnostic, communication and awareness system, consistent with the lessons and tools developed within the framework of the AAP Collection, but adapted to the specificities of the habitat individual. Like the AAP Collecte, this market targeting suburban housing is part of the specific objective OS 2.6 Promoting the transition to a circular economy of the Île-de-France and Seine Basin Regional Program.
